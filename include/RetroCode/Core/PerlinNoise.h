		 *
		 * Perlin noise is a type of gradient noise that can be used to create natural-looking 
		 * textures, such as clouds, terrain, or marble. It is based on interpolating random values
		 * at each integer coordinate of a grid, and using the fractional part of the point
		 * as the interpolation parameter. The result is a smooth and continuous noise function.
		 *
		 * @param x The x coordinate of the point
		 * @param y The y coordinate of the point

		 * @return A Perlin noise value
